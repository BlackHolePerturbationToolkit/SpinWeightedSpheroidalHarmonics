The SpinWeightedSpheroidalHarmonics package for Mathematica provides functions for computing
spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics, spin-weighted spherical harmonics and their associated eigenvalues.
Support is included for both arbitrary-precision numerical evaluation, and for series expansions.

## Getting the package

The latest development version will always be available from the project git
repository:

```bash
git clone https://bitbucket.org/barrywardell/SpinWeightedSpheroidalHarmonics
```


## Requirements

The SpinWeightedSpheroidalHarmonics package requires a recent version of Mathematica. It is typically tested with only the latest available version.


## Installation

Clone the repository and place it somewhere on Mathematica's $Path.
Typical locations are inside ${HOME}/.Mathematica/Applications/ for Linux or
inside ${HOME}/Library/Mathematica/Applications/ for Mac OSX.


## Usage

The package may be loaded into Mathematica using the command:

```Mathematica
<< SpinWeightedSpheroidalHarmonics`
```


## Examples

Examples are included in the documentation. See the
SpinWeightedSpheroidalHarmonics page in Documentation Center.
